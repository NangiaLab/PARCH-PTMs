The repository contains the results of PARCH analysis conducted on post-translational modifications of proteins,  including phosphorylation, acetylation, monomethylation.

Each **subfolder named after the respective proteins** contains the following files in each of them:
- PDB files of the proteins in unmodified and modified states (wt-unmodified, ph-phosphorylation, ac-acetylated, me-monomethylation), with PARCH values written as B-factors. 
- a CSV file summarizing the PARCH results along the amino acid sequence upon PTMs.
